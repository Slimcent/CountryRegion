## Tech Stack

**C#, .Net6.0, .NetStandard2.1**, 



## How Do I Get Started

First, install NuGet. Then, install CountryRegion from the package manager console:

```C#   
   NuGet\Install-Package CountryRegion -Version 1.0.10
```
 This command is intended to be used within the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio, as it uses the NuGet module's version of Install-Package.


Or from the .NET CLI as:
```C#   
   dotnet add package CountryRegion --version 1.0.8
```

Finally, import into the file:
```C#   
   using CountryRegion;
```
